<div class="info">  
 <p>Once a piece has been bisque-fired it is no longer soft. For the particular type of T1 clay we used for wheel throwing, this also means that the pieces look a ghostly color of white.</p>   
<p> The next step after bique-firing is to grind (if needed), glaze the piece, and fire it in the kiln.</p>
    
<p>More images will be uploaded later to provide a better idea.</p>
