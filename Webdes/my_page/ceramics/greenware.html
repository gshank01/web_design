<div class="info">    
<p>The following pieces are considered to be greenware. This means that they have not yet been fired (either bisque fired or the final cone 6 or 10 firing). </p>
<p>These pieces were still soft when the photos were taken, and will shrink by an incredible 20% in size before they are finished. Not all clay shrinks as much as 20%, but because of the high water content in the Amherst brand these pieces do.</p>
